                <h1>Hi, I am Riya!</h1>
                <p>Hi! I am a second-year computational media major 
                    at the Georgia Institute of Technology! 
                    My threads are interaction design and people as 
                    I have a growing interest in interaction design 
                    as well as the psychology behind human decision-making 
                    and behavior. I also love music dearly as I am 
                    a pianist, singer, and songwriter! Some other fun 
                    facts about me include that I love matcha, cats, 
                    and journaling, I am left handed, and I have 
                    worked as a medical assistant in an urgent care.</p>
